The programming language **F#** is part of the .NET ecosystem. It is a **functional-first programming language** that is integrated into the .NET runtime and libraries. Here's a breakdown:

1. **F# as a Language**: 
   - F# is specifically designed to support functional programming but also supports object-oriented and imperative programming paradigms.
   - It is fully supported by Microsoft and the .NET Foundation.

2. **.NET Ecosystem**:
   - F# runs on the .NET runtime (CoreCLR for .NET Core/modern .NET and Mono for cross-platform).
   - It can use any library available in the .NET ecosystem, including those written in C# or VB.NET.

3. **Usage with .NET**:
   - F# code is compiled to intermediate language (IL), just like other .NET languages.
   - F# projects are typically managed using `.fsproj` files, similar to `.csproj` files for C#.

4. **Tooling and Integration**:
   - F# is supported in IDEs like Visual Studio and JetBrains Rider, as well as lightweight editors like Visual Studio Code.
   - It works with .NET SDK tools (`dotnet` CLI) for building, running, and managing F# applications.

So, **F#** is not a separate entity from .NETâ€”it is a language within the .NET framework. **F\***, on the other hand, is not a recognized language or framework term within the .NET space.
